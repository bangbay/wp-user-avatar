**WP User Avatar**

Download the plugin at: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-user-avatar/

**Description**

WordPress currently only allows you to use custom avatars that are uploaded through [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/). WP User Avatar enables you to use any photo uploaded into your Media Library as an avatar. This means you use the same uploader and library as your posts. No extra folders or image editing functions are necessary.

WP User Avatar also lets you:

* Upload your own Default Avatar in your Discussion settings.
* Show the user's [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/) avatar or Default Avatar if the user doesn't have a WP User Avatar image.
* Use the <code>[avatar]</code> shortcode in your posts. The shortcode will work with any theme, whether it has avatar support or not.

This plugin uses the Media uploader introduced in WordPress 3.5, but is also backwards-compatible to WordPress 3.1.
